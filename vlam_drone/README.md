This dataset consists of a single demonstration episode of a drone performing a complete flight through all arch gates. Each step contains an RGB camera image (resized to 64x64), the drone's velocity state `[vx, vy, vz, yaw_rate]`, the corresponding action, and a user instruction string along with its precomputed 512-dimensional language embedding. Rewards are 0 for all intermediate steps and 1 at the final step, with appropriate flags for `is_first`, `is_last`, and `is_terminal`.
